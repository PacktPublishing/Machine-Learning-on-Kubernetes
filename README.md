This is the code repository for [Machine Learning on Kubernetes](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-on-kubernetes/9781803241807?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803241807), published by Packt.

**A practical handbook for building and using a complete open source machine learning platform on Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
MLOps is an emerging field that aims to bring repeatability, automation, and standardization of the software engineering domain to data science and machine learning engineering. By implementing MLOps with Kubernetes, data scientists, IT professionals, and data engineers can collaborate and build machine learning solutions that deliver business value for their organization.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the different stages of a machine learning project
* Use open source software to build a machine learning platform on Kubernetes
* Implement a complete ML project using the machine learning platform presented in this book
* Improve on your organization's collaborative journey toward machine learning
* Discover how to use the platform as a data engineer, ML engineer, or data scientist
* Find out how to apply machine learning to solve real business problems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
docker tag scikit-notebook:v1.1.0 quay.io/ml-on-k8s/scikitnotebook:v1.1.0
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, data engineers, IT platform owners, AI product owners, and data architects who want to build their own platform for ML development. Although this book starts with the basics, a solid understanding of Python and Kubernetes, along with knowledge of the basic concepts of data science and data engineering will help you grasp the topics covered in this book in a better way.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

### Software and Hardware List


| Software required                    | OS required                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -----------------------------------|
| kubernetes, Python, Spark, MLflow,   | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
| Seldon, Airflow                      |                                    |

Running the platform requires a good amount of compute resources. If you do not have
the required number of CPU cores and memory on your desktop or laptop computer, we
recommend running a virtual machine on Google Cloud or any other cloud platform
